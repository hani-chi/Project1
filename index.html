            <div>
                <p>My name is Hanah Sakinovic, and I'm  17 year old high school student interested in tech. I
                am a student in STLCAPS, a nationally recognized program that allows students to experience and grow in their desired areas of interest. 
                Also, I happen to be an alumni for Girls Who Code, a coding organization that is striving to close the gender gap in technology. 
                I have many goals for myself, not just in tech, but in life in general, and I will work hard to achieve those goals.</p>

                <p>Since I was a kid, art and design has been a big part of my life. One of my first dream careers was to be an interior designer. 
                    As I grew older, this branched off into architecture and more tech-related design careers, like graphic designer, website designer, and UX/UI designer. 
                    I didn't want to give up my love for art for more practical, useful jobs and better pay, 
                    so I'm searching for a career that will let me continue my passion but also do technology, which is one of the most rapidly advancing industry.</p>

                <p>I have a passion for fashion; I've been putting outfits together by myself since I was young, and I've dabbled in many different aesthetics.
                    This love for fashion made me consider becoming a stylist or a designer, but I don't think I'd want to monetize off of this passion in that way. 
                    Fashion is therapeutic for me, and shopping for a specific piece or style is exhilerating and just fun, to put it simply. </p>

                <img src="media/dreams/cat-cafe.jpg"> 
                <p>One of my dreams is to start a cat cafe that also has a social cause. I'm not sure where I might make this, but NYC is lookin' pretty good for it. 
                    I was inspired to start this type of business after visiting one in my hometown for the first time; the vibe inside the cafe made me never want to leave. 
                    After some research, I saw that there weren't as many cat cafes in America as there should be, so I thought it would be cool to open one myself.
                    I didn't just want to make a cafe, though; I thought of perhaps creating a safe place or shelter for teenagers or women of all backgrounds that need any help. 
                    It could also serve as a donation center for clothes, food, and other basic needs. I also had this desire to help my communities and guide people into a better way of life. 
                    I'm not exactly sure how feasible this idea is, but I definitely want to look into it.
